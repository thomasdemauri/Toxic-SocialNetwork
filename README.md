# ToxicNetwork Crew

Welcome to the **ToxicNetwork Crew** project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com).

This is an **experimental project under active development** that aims to **simulate and study toxic dynamics commonly found in social networks**, such as harassment, polarization, misinformation amplification, and coordinated negative behavior.

The project uses a **multi-agent AI architecture** to model different roles and interaction patterns, allowing agents to collaboratively reproduce (and later analyze or mitigate) toxic behaviors in online environments.

## Project Goals

- Simulate toxic interactions present in social networks  
- Explore how different agent roles contribute to toxicity propagation  
- Experiment with moderation, counter-speech, and mitigation strategies  
- Evaluate how fine-tuned language models behave under adversarial or toxic contexts  

This project leverages **fine-tuned language models created using Azure AI Foundry**, allowing greater control over model behavior, tone, and response patterns when exposed to toxic prompts.
